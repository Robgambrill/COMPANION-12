# COMPANION-12
A suite of scripts written in python to download and archive the public posts and comments of a reddit user. 
Some of the scripts are to be run manually, others are suitable for running automatically as chron jobs (bots).

The name COMPANION-12 is taken from a series of stories being written by redditor _9MOTHER9HORSE9EYES9.

By default these scripts archive the works of that author, but can be changed to backup your own or any
other user's posts and comments. Other uses might be Stylometric Analysis, Project Collaboration, etc.
