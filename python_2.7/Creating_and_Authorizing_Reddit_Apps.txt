To use Scripts and Bots with the Reddit API, one must first obtain credentials for your script from Reddit itself. 

To do this, you goto  https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps, login (if neccesary), and click the button called "Create application".

You will see some fields where you need to provide some info.

Check the radio button that says "Script".

In the "Redirect uri" field put http://127.0.0.1:65010/authorize_callback 

Now think of a name and type it in the field name. Put a description in the description field as well, if you like.

Click the "Create App" button.

Now you have a screen with all the information needed to run your script with the Reddit API.

Under the name of your script, under where is says "Personal Use Script", you will see string of letters and numbers. That is 
your scripts CLIENT_ID. The name displayed will be your USER_AGENT, and the string next to "Secret" is your CLIENT_SECRET. 

You can go back at any time and look at this information. You will see a box for your script under Developed Applications. You 
can click edit to view the credentials. There you can also click "delete app" if you are no longer using the script.  

Open the C-12.ini file in a text editor (ie, emacs, vim, notepad,etc.).

Look for a section that looks like this...

[Credentials]
USER_AGENT:
CLIENT_ID:
CLIENT_SECRET:

Specifically, you want to fill out the fields in the [Credentials] section. Add to the
USER_AGENT, CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET lines with the information
you got above. Usually you can just "cut and paste" this information into those lines. 

When you are done it should look something like this...

[Credentials]
USER_AGENT: My_Cool_Script (by /u/Somebody/)		<--The name you made chose above
CLIENT_ID: NM3a5r76be5fjsdkjfdkjds			<--A bunch of random looking stuff
CLIENT_SECRET: _fjsdlq3484h5jdlu8l  			<--A bunch of random looking stuff  



(Note: The example strings above will not work, I just made them up.)

When finished, save the file.

Now you should be able to run the scripts in python, if you get authorization errors, you probably have an error on 
one of those lines you just changed.

From the command prompt run..

python first_run.py

... to build up a the file set for the first time.

After that, you may run..

python companion-12.py 

--- either from the command line or as a chron job to check for the latest posts.


 Next thing I plan to do is port these scripts to python3 and add a Configuration GUI program to make this easier. It will walk the user through registering the app so you can send yourself a message when a new post arrives. I will then create window executables from the python3 sources.
